##
  ### Eliminate Testing Delays
    Easily simulate interactions with dependent components that are not available, not yet implemented or still evolving.
  ### Enable Continuous Testing
    Stabilize access to your dependent systems so that your continuous tests execute completely, reliably and accuratelyâ€“ every time.
  ### Increase Automation Rates
     Making API simulation accessible to all testers and developers helps the team complete more automated testing.
