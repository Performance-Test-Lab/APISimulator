# APISimulator
Some services, such as third-party APIs (e.g., payment gateways), mainframes, or external databases, might be difficult to access for testing. They might have a per-use cost, be behind a firewall, or be available for testing only at specific times. Service virtualization allows you to create an internal, controlled environment to test against, removing these constraints
## Benefits of API simulation in Performance Testing
  ### Reduce Cost
    Reduce the cost by eliminating the requirement for access to constrained business critical infra, thridparty systems, or pay –per-use cloud components for tetsing
  ### Eliminate Testing Delays
    Easily simulate interactions with dependent components that are not available, not yet implemented or still evolving.
  ### Enable Continuous Testing
    Stabilize access to your dependent systems so that your continuous tests execute completely, reliably and accurately– every time.
  ### Increase Automation Rates
     Making API simulation accessible to all testers and developers helps the team complete more automated testing.
